<h1> The Statue of Liberty </h1>
<p> The Statue of Liberty was built over nine years <br> by French sculptor Auguste Bartholdi. <br> Upon its completion 
in 1884 all 350 individual pieces of the statue were <br> packed into 214 crates for the ling boat ride from France to New York. </p>
<hr>
<p> The statue arrived in America several months later <br> and was reconstructed on Liberty Island. <br> Auguste Bartholdi thought that the New 
York harbor was the perfect <br> setting for his masterpiece because it was where immigrants got their <br> first view of the New World. 	</p>
